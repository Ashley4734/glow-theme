    "Description": "Effective cleansing is essential for healthy, hydrated skin and that includes thorough make-up removal. Sleeping in make-up disrupts the nocturnal renewal processes of the skin which can lead to breakouts, irritation and inflammation. Dr. Barbara Sturm's lightweight and non-greasy MAKE-UP REMOVER effectively and gently cleanses the skin, removing all traces of make-up including stubborn, long-wear foundation and waterproof mascara. \n\nThe formulation consists of two phases that are combined by shaking the bottle. The water phase is enriched with micelles; tiny clusters of molecules which bind to oil, removing both water-soluble and fat-soluble make-up residue and dirt for clean and refreshed skin. The oil phase, which contains Almond, Apricot and Sunflower Seed Oils, as well as valuable moisturizers Betaine, Hyaluronic Acid and Biosaccharides, supports the skin’s protective lipid layer, balances the skin’s delicate pH and leaves the complexion soft and supple. \n\nAlongside its cleansing and moisturizing benefits, the MAKE-UP REMOVER contains prebiotics to strengthen the microbiome and support the skin’s defense against environmental stressors, such as pollution, UV damage and atmospheric skin aging. The MAKE-UP REMOVER is fragrance-free, vegan and suitable for sensitive skin. \n\nHOW TO USE\n\nShake the MAKE-UP REMOVER well and apply to a cotton pad. \n\nGently sweep across skin to remove makeup. For heavy makeup, leave on for a few seconds, then gently wipe off.\n\nFollow with Dr. Barbara Sturm’s CLEANSER.",

Stage 3: 4am onwards - HYDRATE - As skin reaches its peak permeability, this is the point to deliver deeply intensive hydration to nourish, revitalize, and ensure longevity. 4D Hyaluronic acid delivers deeply intensive hydration to nourish, revitalize, and ensure longevity.
